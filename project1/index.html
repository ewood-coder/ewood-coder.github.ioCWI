                <h1 class="insurances"><b><u>Dr. Shannon Farris</u></b></h1>
                    <p class="textboxFontSize">
                        Dr. Farris wanted to get started in dentistry to provide her patients with a 
                        better experience than she was given. (She had braces for seven years during her 
                        childhood!) Dr. Farris received her BS in Microbiology from Brigham Young 
                        University and graduated with her DMD from University of Louisville School
                        of Dentistry in 2015. After having worked as an associate in other offices, 
                        Dr. Farris realized starting her own practice would allow her the freedom to 
                        create the dental experience she always envisioned for her patients while 
                        being able to spend quality time with her family. Dr. Farris has been 
                        happily married to her husband, Joseph, for eleven years and, together, they have 
                        four children. Learning new things and interesting facts, spending time outside 
                        enjoying the beautiful weather, and making people smile are just a few of Dr. 
                        Farris's favorite things to do!
