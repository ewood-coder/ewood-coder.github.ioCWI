        <h1 class="blueBack2"><u>General Dentistry FAQ's</u></h1>

        <button class="accordion">Why should I go to the dentist regularly?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Many people do not see a dentist on a regular basis. They only go when they 
                have a problem. This is known as "crisis treatment" versus "preventive treatment." 
                While these patients may feel they are saving money, it often ends up costing 
                much more in dollars and time. This is because many dental problems do not 
                have symptoms until they reach the advanced stages of the disease process. 
                An example is tooth decay. It is typical to hear, "Nothing hurts... I don't 
                have any problems."<br><br>
                Tooth decay often does not hurt until it gets close to the nerve of the tooth. 
                It is not uncommon to see a patient with a huge cavity who has never felt a 
                thing. The dentist can usually detect a cavity 3-4 years before it develops 
                any symptoms. This early detection can help you prevent root canal treatment.

        <button class="accordion">Why should I floss, isn't brushing enough?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Flossing reduces the number of bacteria in your mouth. There are millions 
                of these microscopic creatures feeding on food particles left on your teeth. 
                These bacteria live in plaque which can be removed by flossing. Brushing your 
                teeth gets rid of some of the bacteria in your mouth. Flossing gets rid of 
                the bacteria the toothbrush can't get to. That's the bacteria hiding in the 
                tiny spaces between your teeth. If you do not floss, you allow plaque to 
                remain between your teeth. Eventually it hardens into tartar. Plaque can 
                be removed by brushing. Only the dentist can remove tartar.<br><br>
                Ask your dentist to show you the proper way to floss. You will both notice 
                the difference at the next cleaning appointment.

        <button class="accordion">How can I get my kids to brush their teeth?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Make it fun! If you are enthusiastic about brushing your teeth, your children 
                will also be enthusiastic. Children want to do the things their parents do. 
                If your children see you brushing your teeth and displaying good dental habits, 
                they will follow. Ask the dentist for other creative ways to get children to 
                brush their teeth.<br><br>
                Getting your children to brush starts with taking them to the dentist at an 
                early age. All children should be seen by their first birthday or 6 months 
                after the eruption of the first tooth.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <button class="accordion">How can I prevent cavities?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Always spend two to three minutes brushing your teeth. It takes that 
                long to get rid of the bacteria that destroy tooth enamel. Do not brush 
                too hard. It takes very little pressure to remove bacteria and plaque. 
                Floss at least once a day. Flossing is the only way to get bacteria from 
                between your teeth.<br><br>
                Watch the sugar you eat. There is sugar in candy, fruits, crackers and 
                chips. These are the foods that the bacteria in your mouth like best. 
                Be mindful of foods like raisins and peanut butter that stick to your teeth. 
                They can provide a constant supply for the bacteria eating into your teeth. 
                Try to minimize the times during the day when sweet items are eaten and 
                brush your teeth afterwards.<br><br>
                If you cannot brush after a meal, rinse your mouth with water - which can 
                help to remove food from your teeth. Chewing sugarless gum after a meal can 
                also help. Chewing deskulates the flow of your saliva which acts as a natural
                 plaque-fighting substance. And do not forget your regular dental visits. 
                 Good dental habits will go a long way toward a no-cavity visit.

        <button class="accordion">What can I do about sensitive teeth?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Sensitivity toothpaste, which contains strontium chloride or potassium 
                nitrate are very effective in treating sensitive teeth. After a few weeks 
                of use, you may notice a decrease in sensitivity. Highly acidic foods such 
                as oranges, grapefruits and lemons, as well as tea and soda can increase 
                tooth sensitivity, and work against sensitivity toothpaste. If you do not 
                get relief by brushing gently and using desensitizing toothpaste, see 
                your dentist. There are special compounds that can be applied in-office 
                to the roots of your tooth to reduce - if not eliminate - the sensitivity. 
                High-fluoride containing home care products can also be recommended to 
                help reduce tooth sensitivity.<br><br>
                Ask the friendly staff at Dentlytical Solutions for more information on sensitive teeth.

        <button class="accordion">What is periodontal disease?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <br>
                Periodontal disease is inflammation and infection of the gums and 
                supporting bone structure, which if left untreated, can cause permanent 
                jaw bone destruction and possible tooth loss. Untreated periodontal disease 
                has been linked to increased risk for conditions such as heart disease, 
                stroke, low birth weight babies, pre-term delivery, respiratory disease, 
                and prostate cancer. An advanced stage of periodontal disease exhibits 
                inflamed gums pulling away from your bone and teeth. Other signs of 
                periodontal disease include:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bad breath</li>
                    <li>Red or swollen gums</li>
                    <li>Loose teeth or teeth that have moved</li>
                    <li>Sensitive teeth</li>
                    <li>Pus coming from around the teeth</li>
                    <li>Pain when chewing</li>
                    <li>Tender gums</li>
                    <li>Bleeding gums</li>
                </ul>
                Treatment of early periodontal disease can be performed in-office. 
                However, advanced stages may require surgery. Periodontal disease can 
                be prevented and treated successfully by seeing your dentist and dental 
                hygienist regularly and following recommended care plans.
