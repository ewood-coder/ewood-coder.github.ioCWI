            <h1><u>Where am I from?</u></h1>
            <p>
                I was born and raised here in Boise, Idaho. Boise has always been my home and the city I love, 
                but I've always wanted to try living somewhere else just to see what it feels like. If I ever get
                a job opportunity somewhere else, it'd be the perfect chance to try just that.
            </p>

            <h1><u>What Am I Doing Now?</u></h1>
            <p>
                Currently, I work part-time (elsewhere) and I am a full-time student at the College of Western Idaho (CWI) working on 
                my associates in software development (graduation in 2022). As for the future, I will be transferring over to another
                college to start my bachelors of science and continue my coding education.
            </p>

        <section id="section3">
            <h1><u>Interests/Hobbies</u></h1>
            <p>
                I have been extremely passionate about video games since I was a child. Because of this,
                I have grown to love technology in general. My passions have grown from just video games to 
                discovering the world of computers and then to coding, which is where I'm at now.
                I've really grown to love HTML, CSS along with web design and I can't wait to learn more
                to grow my skills and eventually become a part of the coding industry.
            </p>
            <p>Technology is a phenomenal tool that will grow and develop as society does. I want to be a part of that growth,
                teaching people how to work with the tech they use every day and maybe even be part of the 
                content they consume daily.
