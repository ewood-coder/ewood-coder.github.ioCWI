        <h1 class="FixMargin"><u>How I Got Into Software Development</u></h1>
        <p>Throughout the entirety of high school and the first two years of college,
           many of my instructors and peers told me that I'd need to figure out what I'd
           want to do with my future as soon as possible. I spent much time contacting
           counselors about career paths, interviewing people I knew about their own careers,
           and lots more just trying to get an idea of something I may enjoy doing.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, I started to lose faith in my future thinking I'd end up in a career I hated,
           or worse, no career at all. I started thinking hard about my hobbies and what I enjoyed doing
           and it really came down to technology such as video games, computers, etc.
        </p>
        <p>I decided that I needed to broaden my perspective and maybe learn something new, so I looked
           at the available classes relating to technology at my college and software development was the
           first thing to appear. Before I knew it, I was meeting with the counselor in charge of the program
           and I was enrolled into a class I knew nothing about. <b>I was scared</b>, but I kept a positive
           mental attitude and told myself that I'd never figure out what I'd want to do if I didn't try
           things out.
        </p>
        <p>Currently (as of November 2020), I am nearing the end of my first semester in the software development program and 
           I'm loving it. I've discovered that coding and creating web pages is super fun and getting to collaborate with others doing
           the same thing only makes it better. So far, it seems like this is a career path that I will enjoy
           and I plan on continuously increasing my skill set, learning new things and making connections that'll last a lifetime.
        </p>
